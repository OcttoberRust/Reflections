When would you want to create a new repository rather than keeping all your work local?

ANSWER: You would want to create a new remote repository when access to the local repository
is limited or when important production code needs a central location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

ANSWER: Pulling changes automatically may effect unprepared code in the local
repository. Pulling manually ensures the user is aware of current changes
to the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

ANSWER:
Forks - Github operation that clones from one repository into an empty one.
Forks would be used to create one's own implementation of a project from another
repository.
Clones - Downloads an entire repository and its history into a local repository.
Branches - Any branch diverging from the main branch, usually for experimentation
or non production code.
