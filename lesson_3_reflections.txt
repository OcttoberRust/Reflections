When would you want to create a new repository rather than keeping all your work local?

ANSWER: You would want to create a new remote repository when access to the local repository
is limited or when important production code needs a central location.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

ANSWER: Pulling changes automatically may effect unprepared code in the local
repository. Pulling manually ensures the user is aware of current changes
to the remote repository.
