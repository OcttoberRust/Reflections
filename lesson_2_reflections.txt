What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

ANSWER: When you initialize a repository, you create a ".git" file. The command
to do so is "git init". This needs to be done to keep track of commits of files
within the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

ANSWER: The staging area is necessary because you may not want to include
certain file in the final stage. Those unnecessary files files could add up and
make the commits a clutter.
